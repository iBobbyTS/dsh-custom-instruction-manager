/**
 * Hub sidecar store: remembers which skills the hub toggled off and the
 * user's organization/tracking records. Disabling renames the skill's
 * SKILL.md (or flat .md) out of the filesystem provider's discovery shapes,
 * so the provider catalog alone cannot see disabled skills; this store keeps
 * name/path/root so the GUI can list them and re-enable. It also persists
 * upstream source records (repo + commit snapshot for update checks), the
 * market source list, and the trash (skills removed after upstream deletion).
 *
 * State file: $DSH_HOME/plugin/data/custom-instruction-manager/state.json — a
 * small JSON document written atomically (tmp file + rename).
 *
 * 按职责拆分后的重导出入口：老 `from './store.ts'` 写法保持可用，
 * 新代码可按需直引 `from './store/<module>.ts'`。
