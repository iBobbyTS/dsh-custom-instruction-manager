/**
 * Trigger statistics: how often each skill was actually invoked. The count
 * comes from the local session logs, read through the host's `sessionQuery`
 * service (which transparently decompresses the on-disk JSONL.zstd artifacts).
 *
 * A skill is invoked two ways, both recorded in the log:
 *  - model-invoked: a `tool/call` event for the `skill` tool, whose raw
 *    `arguments` JSON names the requested skill (see @deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-skill);
 *  - user-explicit: a `user/message` event whose `source.kind ===
 *    'skill-invocation'` (the MessageSourceMap augmentation from
 *    @deepseek-ai/dsh-skill).
 *
 * Fork copies share invocation identity and count once across retained logs.
 * Deleting the original keeps a surviving copy; independent own calls stay distinct.
 * Only identity hashes, names and timestamps enter the derived scan cache.
 *
 * Counting is per-skill-name, not per-source: a name may resolve to different
 * files across projects, but the model-facing identity is the kebab-case name.
 *
 * Two read paths, cheapest first:
 *
 * 1. Cold path (preferred): the host's `sessionPersistence` seam serves raw
 *    stored logs — decompress + parse only, no Session restore, no
 *    structuredClone-per-event, no deepFreeze. `list()` also reports an opaque
 *    per-session revision token, so the checkpoint re-reads exactly the
 *    sessions whose revision changed (plus live sessions via the query seam).
 *    No time watermark, no daily full reconciliation.
 * 2. Query fallback: `sessionQuery.readSession` restores + replay-validates a
 *    full Session per call (structuredClone × 2 + deepFreeze). Reads are
 *    strictly sequential (concurrency 1) so at most one restored log is
 *    resident, and a per-session checkpoint + incremental scans keeps the
 *    repeat cost to the recent window: a full scan decompresses every session
 *    log, which grows linearly with total history. Sessions older than the
 *    effective watermark are therefore treated as finalized — their
 *    per-session invocation identities live in the checkpoint (persisted by the host via the
 *    sidecar) and are skipped on incremental scans; only the recent window is
 *    re-read. A daily full reconciliation rebuilds the cache and advances the
 *    watermark, so a resumed old session is eventually re-counted. On top of
 *    that, the reader's TTL adapts to the measured scan duration
 *    (STATS_TTL_SCAN_FACTOR), so a heavy scan also lowers its own frequency.
 *
 * Rolling window (statsWindowDays > 0): totals only include sessions created
 * within the last N days. The watermark then equals the window edge, so
 * sessions outside the window are neither re-read nor counted, and the
 * reconciliation prunes their cache entries. Changing the configured window
 * forces one full reconciliation immediately (the checkpoint records the
 * window it was built for), so the new semantics take effect on the next scan
 * instead of up to a day later.
