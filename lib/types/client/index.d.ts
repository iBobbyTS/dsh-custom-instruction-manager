/**
 * Browser-half entry for the dsh-skill-hub plugin — runs inside the dsh
 * web GUI.
 *
 * Registers the dsh-skill-hub locale dictionaries and mounts:
 *  - a global Skills sidebar entry plus its main panel: catalog, search,
 *    enable/disable, diagnostics, new-skill form;
 *  - the chat "/" menu skill dots, colored from the same config the panel reads.
 *
 *  - a configuration card in the `plugins.bundle.config` slot, keyed by the
 *    BUNDLE PACKAGE NAME, rendered on the plugin's own page in the Plugins
 *    manager (sidebar → 插件 → dsh-skill-hub). dsh 0.1.7 has no auto-generated
 *    config page: the manager only renders that section for bundles that
 *    register this slot, and the card writes through the shared config form
 *    (`ctx.configForms.get(skill-hub)`), the same form the host routes read.
 *
 * Failure policy: mounting problems are logged, never thrown — the web
 * shell fails the whole boot when a plugin apply throws, and an external
 * plugin must not take the GUI down.
 *
 * Export discipline (packages/client rule): the /client surface carries
 * what cordis loading needs plus types only — all value exports stay
 * internal.
