/**
 * Slash-menu skill dots: puts the invocation-status dot (model-callable blue /
 * user-only green) in front of every skill candidate in the chat `/` menu.
 *
 * Mechanism: hooks the `/skill` source's `candidates` so the hub learns which
 * rows are skill candidates and how each one classifies for model invocation,
 * then injects the dot straight into the rendered option rows. The menu's
 * `icon` slot is unusable for this — `MenuView` narrowed `icon` to an enum
 * ('file' | 'folder' | 'session') and renders it through `ReferenceIcon`, so a
 * custom element never reaches the DOM. Colors come from the same settings
 * (dotModelColor / dotUserColor) and the same `modelInvocable` classification
 * the panel legend uses — so the chat menu and the Settings → 技能 panel stay
 * in sync, and editing the color updates both.
 *
 * The skill source is registered by the core plugin under the `name` "skill"
 * on the `/` trigger; re-registering the same name would throw, so this wraps
 * the already-registered source object instead (found through the runtime
 * source registry, which the frozen contract exposes only as `registerSource`
 * / `sessionOf` — the lookup below is defensive: it never throws).
